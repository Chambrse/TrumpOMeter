This site helps visualize Trump's current mood. Is he more apt to sign a new DACA bill or some other morally positive initiative, or will he finally mash that red nuclear button on his desk? find out here.

First, using the Twitter API, we pull trump's most recent tweets. then, using a text analysis API, we analyze them for their sentiment. Average the results, and print a graph to help the people know when its safe and when our fearless leader is in a sour mood.
